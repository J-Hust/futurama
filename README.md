# [Bender (and other characters') Most (and least) Frequently Used Words](https://j-hust.github.io/futurama/)


### Background
In season 3 episode 2 of Futurama, Bender has a bomb implanted in his chest that's designed to explode when he says his most frequently used word.  That word, of course, is 'ass'.

Or is it?  I wrote this script in R to create a word frequency table for Bender and other Futurama characters and show what words they actually use the most (as well as least).


### Usage
If you want to gather the data yourself, run futurama_words.R in RStudio or your favorite IDE capable of running R code.  index.html uses D3.js to load the csv and build the interactive table.  Note that I wrote the R script probably in 2016 and haven't updated it since then, so there's a chance it no longer scrapes the correct data from the Infosphere.
